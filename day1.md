# framework and libraries

  ## front end---> reaact.js, vue js, angular
  ## backend ----> nodejs, laravel, django

# Relation

* Contents are received by frontend and passed through API so that backend gets it and keeps it in warehouse(databases)

* frontend----> API -------> backend <----------> Database

* API ---- bridge between frontend and backend (connection between them)

* ORM - object relational mapping -----> acts as a connection/channel between databse and backend
     ORM tools- mongoose, sequel



* NodeJS----- Runtime platform for javascript(it gives wings to Javascript)
   npm---- node package manager

* NodeJS is the playground, npm is the store which contains api and ExpressJS is the actual player.


* Package-json file -----> summarize file of your project which includes all description of your project


* Main file of nodejs-- app.js (just like index.html in html,main.c in c, style.css in css)
